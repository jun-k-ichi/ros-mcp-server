# Installation Guide

> ⚠️ **Prerequisite**: You need either ROS installed locally on your machine OR access over the network to a robot/computer with ROS installed. This MCP server connects to ROS systems on a robot, so a running ROS environment is required.

Installation includes the following steps:
- Install the MCP server
  - Clone this repository
  - Instal uv (Python virtual environment manager)
- Install and configure the Language model client
  - Instal any language model client (We demo with Claude Desktop)
  - Configure the client to run the MCP server and connect automatically on launch.
- Install and launch Rosbridge


Below are detailed instructions for each of these steps. 

---
# 1. Install the MCP server (On the host machine where the LLM will be running)

## 1.1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server.git
```

Note the **absolute path** to the cloned directory — you'll need this later when configuring your language model client.

## 1.2. Understanding MCP Server Transport Options

The ROS MCP Server supports multiple transport protocols for communication with language model clients:

- **`stdio`** (default): Direct standard input/output communication - recommended for most clients
- **`http`** or **`streamable-http`**: HTTP-based communication for network access
- **`sse`**: Server-Sent Events (currently unsupported)

You can configure the transport using command-line arguments when starting the server:

```bash
# Default stdio transport (recommended for Claude Desktop, Cursor)
uv run server.py

# HTTP transport with custom host and port
uv run server.py --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
```

**Command-line Arguments:**
- `--transport`: Choose transport protocol (default: stdio, http, streamable-http, sse)
- `--host`: Host address for HTTP-based transports (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `--port`: Port number for HTTP-based transports (default: 9000)

---

## 1.3. Install UV (Python Virtual Environment Manager)

You can install [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) using one of the following methods:

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A: Shell installer</strong></summary>

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: Using pip</strong></summary>

```bash
pip install uv
```

</details>

---

## 1.4. Manual Server Startup (Optional)

For HTTP-based transports, you may need to manually start the MCP server before connecting your language model client:

```bash
# Navigate to the ros-mcp-server directory
cd /path/to/ros-mcp-server

# Start with streamable HTTP transport
uv run server.py --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
```

**Note:** For `stdio` transport (default), the server is automatically started by the language model client, so manual startup is not required.

---

# 2. Install and configure a Language Model Client 

Any LLM client that supports MCP can be used. We use **Claude Desktop** for testing and development.

<summary><strong>Linux (Ubuntu)</strong></summary>

## 2.1. Download Claude Desktop 
- Follow the installation instruction from the community-supported [claude-desktop-debian](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian)

## 2.2. Configure Claude Desktop to launch the MCP server
- Locate and edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
- (If the file does not exist, create it)
```bash
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

- Add the following to the `"mcpServers"` section of the JSON file
- Make sure to replace `<ABSOLUTE_PATH>` with the **full absolute path** to your `ros-mcp-server` folder (note: `~` for home directory may not work in JSON files):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ros-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/<ABSOLUTE_PATH>/ros-mcp-server",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 2.3. Test the connection
- Launch Claude Desktop and check connection status. 
- The ros-mcp-server should be visible in your list of tools.

</p>

## 2.4. Troubleshooting

### Common Connection Issues
- If the `ros-mcp-server` doesn't appear even after correctly configuring `claude_desktop_config.json`, try completely shutting down Claude Desktop using the commands below and then restarting it. This could be a Claude Desktop caching issue.
```bash
# Completely terminate Claude Desktop processes
pkill -f claude-desktop
# Or alternatively
killall claude-desktop

# Restart Claude Desktop
claude-desktop
```

### Transport-Specific Troubleshooting

**stdio Transport Issues:**
- Verify that `uv` is properly installed and accessible
- Check that the server.py file exists in the specified directory
- Ensure the absolute path is correct (no `~` shortcuts in JSON)

**HTTP Transport Issues:**
- Make sure the MCP server is manually started before connecting the client
- Verify the host and port are accessible (default: 127.0.0.1:9000)
- Check for port conflicts with other services
- For network access, use `0.0.0.0` as host instead of `127.0.0.1`

**Testing Server Startup:**
```bash
# Test stdio transport
cd /path/to/ros-mcp-server
uv run server.py --transport stdio

# Test HTTP transport
uv run server.py --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
# Then test connection: curl http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp
```

# 4. You're ready to go!
You can test out your server with any robot that you have running. Just tell your AI to connect to the robot on its target IP. (Default is localhost, so you don't need to tell it to connect if the MCP server is installed on the same machine as your ROS)

✅ **Tip:** If you don't currently have any robots running, turtlesim is considered the hello-ROS robot to experiment with. It does not have any simulation depenencies such as Gazebo or IsaacSim. 

For a complete step-by-step tutorial on using turtlesim with the MCP server and for more information on ROS and turtlesim, see our [Turtlesim Tutorial](../examples/1_turtlesim/README.md).

If you have ROS already installed, you can launch turtlesim with the below command:
**ROS1:**
```
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

**ROS2:**
```
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```
